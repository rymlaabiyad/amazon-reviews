Now that I have mine and have used it for a couple of weeks I can say that hands down, the negative comments I read were far off base. The phone fits snuggly into the plastic shell and the rubberized outer cover fits very nicely over it all providing an excellent grip. The built in covers over the earphone jack, silencing switch and charging port keeps dirt away from the contacts in those areas. The little hole in the top that some think is supposed to be the earphone jack hole is NOT for that at all. That part of the case has to stay open in order for phone's camera to operate correctly. And speaking of the camera, it works perfectly with this case on. I was a bit concerned that the thick, built in screen protector would make it hard for the touch pad to recognize the correct letters when typing texts on the phone but that fear was quickly dispelled. The phone reacted as though there was no screen protector on it at all. The holster\/belt clip that is included with the case works extremely well. It holds the phone securely yet it is easily retrievable from its grip. During my workday, I seldom remove the phone from the holster and just use the phone with it still attached. It works fine and most of the necessary functions are available while still in the holster with the rear camera being the exception. This is not a small little case that will fit nicely in a lady's clutch purse for a night out on the town. It seems to cater more to those in the work force or to those that are on the go and don't have a pocket or other place to keep the phone tucked in to. The one and only drawback of this case as far as I can see is that some fine dust still makes it under the screen protector. Not in huge amounts, but it still makes it in. I'm not too sure what could be done by the manufacturer to prevent this from happening. Maybe a tighter seal around the face? To me, this is a drawback that I will happily deal with because of all of the other really good points. It's easy enough to disassemble and clean out the dust and reassemble (literally two or three minutes) and I'll gladly make that tradeoff.","reviewTime":"07 18, 2013","reviewerID":"A39GFUZUM4OWPJ","reviewerName":"AK Bad Boy","summary":"This is an excellent product and an easy five stars..","unixReviewTime":1374105600,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":1,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":1,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":1,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":1,"part":1,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"Fits Iphone perfect and is still in use after a year.

There's a great grip to the case, as well.- The case has easy access to charging cables as well as the the headphone jack.The Cons:- The screen cover easily gathers particles and scratches, which do not come off, regardless of what I've tried cleaning it with.- Slightly bulky feel, and the great grip does make this case a pain to slide it into your pocket- The screen cover is elevated from the actual screen of your phone, so you need to put added pressure in order to read the screen.-The case does not actually cover the two camera portions of the phone, both of which are highly important to me.

The price difference made it tempting, but I'm glad I chose the Defender series for its comprehensive protection, including a screen protector.  I also like that it comes with a sturdy holster, which while I probably won't use, it's a nice addition.The instructions are simple, but I did view a 'how-to' video on the Amazon site prior to installing it, and after taking a quick look at the enclosed picture directions.Installation of the case is easy and quick.  The case arrives as it will be installed.  You peel off the silicone outer shell, to expose a hard case with the screen protector as part of it.  Three snaps (two on the sides and one on the top) open the inner case.  You place your iPhone back side to the Otterbox padded logo).  I suggest placing the bottom in first, as it seemed to work best for me.Place the top of the inner cover on the phone and match up the holes with the Home button and receiver (earpiece).  Snap the three snaps together to enclose the phone and then you're ready for the outer silicone layer.The outer layer went on easily, but I worked again from the bottom of the phone, making sure I adjusted around the ports.  I noted some puckering along the edges initially, but found that if I seated the silicone properly around the snaps, the case fit perfectly.Ports are easy to access, as are buttons.  Some effort will have to be made to get to certain things, but hey, it's that way with most any case. Speakers are unaffected by this case.The Home button and volume buttons work fine, as does the on\/off.  The screen protector doesn't affect the multi-touch display in any way for me, which makes me very happy.I was a bit hesitant to order this case as I thought it would be too bulky, and yet I wanted as much protection for my iPhone as possible. Ultimately, I'm VERY pleased with the protection, performance and good looks of this case.  I plan on buying others in some more colors, and highly recommend it to others.","reviewTime":"06 15, 2013","reviewerID":"A12DQZKRKTNF5E","reviewerName":"Andrea Polk","summary":"Best Choice for 4S","unixReviewTime":1371254400,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":1,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":1,"work":0,"box":1,"feel":1,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":1,"silicone":1,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":1,"part":1,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"If you like care your gadgets like iPhone you find the best case to protect your device.

The other one I have is one with a bright pink inner case and a grey digital cammo backing. While I liked that one, this one (Light Teal\/Deep Teal) has a great textured backing, unlike the smooth back of my digital cammo case. It give my hands much better grip on my phone.I've had various cases for my phone. From very simple barely-there cases, to the brand new Otterbox Armor case. While the Armor case is pretty awesome, the waterproof features prevent me from hearing callers on my phone very well. So after a few months of using it, I've gone back to my favorite, the Defender.The Defender case is a two part case, with an inner casing and and outer case. The inner case is made of a hard plastic, and actually comes apart into two pieces (front and back). You place your phone in between these two pieces and snap them together, creating a hard plastic shell around your iPhone. The you fit the hard case (with the iPhone in it) into the outer case, which is made of a thick, shock-absorbing rubber. So your phone is actually getting double protection. The hard case protects it from bending or being squished, the soft case absorbs the impact from drops.What makes the Defender awesome is not just all the great protection, but that you get to keep all your phones functionality as well. Buttons are not only easy to press, but tend to be even easier to push down on when in the case. The screen retains all the touch screen sensitivity and call volume and speakerphone is just as loud as it is when there's no case on it at all.About the only thing the Defender doesn't provide is full water proof protection, and after having it with the Otterbox Armor, I've found I prefer it this way. The full waterproof protection lowers call volume and ringer sounds so much, I found I misses calls frequently and had to have my volume on high all the time, to just barely be able to hear people. While the Otterbox Armor is awesome, the Defender worked better for my every day needs. I'll use the Armor when I'm going camping or going to be doing outdoor activities, and use my Defender for everything else.","reviewTime":"04 12, 2013","reviewerID":"A1F7YU6O5RU432","reviewerName":"Angela Streiff","summary":"Love the Defender.

I passed my new phone around to a large group od friends at a luncheon with no worries. The only downside I could find is that the part that covers the charger port does not stay in place when not charging.  It has to be pulled loose to insert the charging cord and then just sort of hangs.  It still covers the port but is loose and can get caught on things.  I am considering just cutting it off.

It lasted for a year until the inner plastic started to crack and creak, which I thought was good run for what I put it through.  This new case is obviously being made by a different crappy Chinese contractor.  The silicon outer will not stay on at all, and continually comes off the thinner side portion if you breathe on it.  The plastic has raised sections of residue from the mold that was used and they didn't even bother to sand down the raised portions.

Those with thicker fingers might encounter some difficulties as a result. The holster arrangement is large, heavy and intrusive on my belt. The phone mounts in it fairly easily but I need two hands to dismount the phone to use it. On the other hand, you know for sure that it is protected from falling out of the holster.

Im confident that after months\/years of dropping my iPhone with this case on it, it will likely hold up. It is sturdy and IS NOT FAKE like some of the other reviews indicate. If you pay 10 bucks for an otterbox, it probably isn't an otterbox. You have to use common sense with deals like that.The case is pretty bulky and the silicone outer shell will make it difficult to get in and out of tight pockets. If you are a girl and keep it in your purse or something it would cause no problems and protect it from getting scratched up from your keys, makeup, pitchforks or whatever it is you people keep in there. As for us dudes if you wear snug fitting jeans it can be a little annoying, but def not a huge problem. If you want protection you have to make some sacrifices. It is much better than raw-dogging it.The built in screen protector certainly does its job. However, it does leave a weird optical effect that makes it look like moisture is trapped underneath. Its quite annoying and even if i clean my phone screen and the bottom of the protector very well, it still occurs. Annoying, but not a deal killer.All in all this case works well. I have read that over time the silicone stretches out but then you just buy a new one. 20-30 bucks every few months for a 200 dollar investment isnt that big of a deal. If thats too much for you to spend go buy a walmart phone.","reviewTime":"06 26, 2012","reviewerID":"A1YXI1QYUODR2F","reviewerName":"B.

The color pattern (realtree camo \/ blaze) is perfect for someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, and even garnered a compliment from my 13 y\/o son - high praise indeed.  The only negative I would point to is the portion of the case that covers the headphone jack - the hole in the cover is offset from the jack, so that you have to open it in order to use headphones while using the case.

He is constantly ruining cell phones - he's gone through 7 in the past 2 1\/2 to 3 years. He is constantly dropping his cell, stuffing it in his pockets, which may be fine for some, but he has tools in a tool belt that constantly slam into his pockets. Someone bought a Defender to work and the threw it on the floor and actually drove a forklift over it - and there was NO damage to the cell phone OR the Defender. That was all I had to see to prove this cell phone protector really works well.  Although my husband is carefull with his cell, the environment he works in isn't always the best for a cell phone. But he has to have it for work so I got the Defender. It is a little bulkier then most, but who cares- it does its job. He uses the case it came with to put his phone in and wears it on his belt. The one and only issue he had in the beginning was it does turn the volume off so he had to turn the phone around to keep the volume buttons for being touched. Problem solved easily and he is extremely happy - and THAT is all that matters to me. He has had it for 2 mmonths now and we live in hot, very humid Texas and he's had no issues with humidity or water problems. Not any dust issues, and working at Home Depot provides TONS of dust! Nothing is destruction proof - you just have to care for your cell. Except that now maybe we won't be buying a cell phone for him every 6 or 7 months! Great product, shipped super fast &lt;within 3 days> - I definitely recommend.","reviewTime":"10 20, 2012","reviewerID":"A158CH42BGFN68","reviewerName":"Cathie","summary":"GREAT Protector for Cell Phone!","unixReviewTime":1350691200,"case":1,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":0,"color":0,"bulky":1,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":1,"price":0,"work":1,"box":0,"feel":1,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":1,"quality":1},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":3,"reviewText":"I got a great savings on this through Amazon.

I also think the silicone case isn't thought out very well.  It has the little flaps that open to get to all of the buttons, and between opening the headphone flap and getting to the do not disturb flap, the silicone rips quickly.  I did contact Otterbox and they replaced it, but it ripped almost a week after I replaced it.  Also it limits you with any kind of docking devices unless you want to take it out of the shell. I am really surprised no one has come up with a system that works between all kinds of purposes.

I also like the colors available for the Otterbox.  It is easy to see which phone is mine and which is my wife's when both are staged for charging.  Choosing different colors eliminates any confusion between the two phones.  The other advantage to the Otterbox is that the exterior skin the Otterbox is made from causes the phone to stay put on a vehicle center console when starting and stopping on a road trip.  The tactile feel of that Otterbox skin is ideal for preventing the iPhone from sliding and falling into the cold drink or hot coffee in the cup holder in front of the console.  The belt carrier is excellent also.  My iPhone has never accidently come out of the belt holster.

When I originally bought my iPhone 4S, I had a very hard plastic case. Not sure how it happened, but I got out of my car and my phone landed on the driveway after falling some distance on the concrete and died in several pieces. Fortunately, I had a warranty that covered a total replacement.I've been using a Spiegen case since then and have been happy with it. However, I wish it had more padding to cushion my phone from possible damage.I received this today  in the mail. While this case is on the bulkier side this is no issue for me. It provides absolutely great coverage, is engineered to accomodate the cutouts, and is made of a very flexible silicon that can accomodate the cords needed for charging. In fact, I am charging it right now. Additionally, the case has a nice holster that works well with the belt I usually wear with my jeans.I never really got the passion or price for the OtterBox case until I looked this over. It is so well padded and offers so much coverage that this should protect an iPhone from most disasters that involve breakage, splintering and cracking, and the dreaded scratches.If you are worried about keeping the phone and Suri safe, this is decidedly a good option if you aren't put off by bulk.","reviewTime":"01 24, 2014","reviewerID":"A2ZY49IDE6TY5I","reviewerName":"Crabigail Cassidy \"Crabby Abby\"","summary":"I Finally Get It","unixReviewTime":1390521600,"case":1,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":1,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":1,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":1,"reviewText":"It did not come with all that it said it had.

Great gift idea!The protection it provides is more than enough for everyday use. Three layers protect the screen, the controls and the iPhone case itself. The clip is awesome - it rotates so that you can hang it vertical or horizontal and it has a notch that keeps it on your belt loop.

No, the Apple iPhone 4S has glass on the front and the back, and if the phone lands just right with the right amount of force the glass can still break.  What this case will do is give you every possible chance that the phone won't break during normal use.One guy said it was hard to go from silent mode to ring mode because he had big hands, that seems impossible to me as I have bigger hands than anyone I know and it's very easy to make the switch.  Sure, you have to open the little rubber flap to access the switch, but that's super easy to do.I've seen reviews complaining of air bubbles between the screen and the case, I've never noticed any with my phone.  Maybe I got lucky and got a phone \/ case pair that fits together perfectly.  My father has the same phone and same case and I have never noticed an air bubble on his phone either.For me, I think this is the best case option.  The only con I can think of is that the case adds a fair amount of weight and size to the slim iPhone, but I actually prefer the feel with it in the case.  Again, I have big hands so your mileage may vary if you prefer your phones to feel as small and light as they can.Once I move on from the iPhone 4S, I'm sure my next phone will be protected by another Otterbox case.","reviewTime":"10 2, 2012","reviewerID":"A2XXBZPQT5EXHV","reviewerName":"Darren O'Neill","summary":"Has Kept My Iphone 4S Like New For A Year","unixReviewTime":1349136000,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":1,"get":1,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":1,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":1},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"Had an earlier version that got so soft that the cover was falling off.This one is MUCH better.

I suggest getting a screen protector and another case efore using this one. Just my personal preference. I would like to see the otterbox armor series coming out. That will be a better choice than this because it will give you a broader coverage of protection.

I happily recommend Otterbox to anyone who needs a protective case for their phones.","reviewTime":"12 17, 2012","reviewerID":"A316MYZ3J1BGIX","reviewerName":"Eli","summary":"Protected!","unixReviewTime":1355702400,"case":1,"phone":0,"otterbox":1,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":1,"rubber":0,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":1,"thing":0,"month":1,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[1,1],"overall":4,"reviewText":"I like this case and it will protect my iPhone well.

Of course, it is not going to protect you phone from water immersion - that is a whole other level - but this case has holder that you can clip to a horizontal or vertical belt or strap or just us it as a cover for your phone when it is in your bag.

The only time I've damaged a phone in an OtterBox is when I waded into a lake, forgetting that my phone was in my pocket, and it was totally submerged for about 5 minutes.  Remember that an OtterBox is not meant to enable your phone to be used underwater - only to help it resist spills or rain.If you want to be nearly certain your phone cannot get damaged, get an OtterBox (if you have gotten your child an expensive phone, then insist that they keep in in their OtterBox).  If you're using a phone for business and you don't want a bulky case and are willing to risk some damage, then you may not want an OtterBox.I give this 5 out of 5 stars for what it is intended to do - protect my phone better than any other case.","reviewTime":"11 3, 2013","reviewerID":"A3VONQL7YW8UPM","reviewerName":"Geoff Ables","summary":"Protects my phone better than any other case","unixReviewTime":1383436800,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":1,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":1,"rubber":0,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":1,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":1},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":4,"reviewText":"The box is quite good at protecting the iphone only that it is a little bulky and I wish it was smaller...","reviewTime":"11 4, 2012","reviewerID":"A2K241CIUSHVQA","reviewerName":"George","summary":"Protects the iphone","unixReviewTime":1351987200,"case":0,"phone":1,"otterbox":1,"iphone":0,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":0,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"Very nice looking and sturdy case for my Iphone.

The case over time wears at these points and the rubber\/plastic begins to tear. Also over time the rubber stretches and deforms slightly making the other part of the case not as snug as it was when it was purchased. HOWEVER it does one helluva job protecting the phone. Since apple was kind enough to put two plates of glass on the phone I figured a case was in order. If you want to protect your phone this is the case for you.

I have been waiting for over a year for the new iphone, as I passed up on the 4 when it came to Verizon.  All the ports are properly lined up except for the earphone jack.  It is off...way off.  But you can open it and put your earphones in.  I don't use the earphones that much, rather a bluetooth device, so this isn't a big deal to me.  The big feature that this has for me is the built in screen protector.  It also makes the phone bulkier which therefore makes it harder to drop.  I used my phone for about three days before this arrived and I had nothing on it.  I almost dropped it several times.  I have not gotten close since I put this cover on.  I like the way it snaps in and out of the belt clip.  Very secure and not too big of a pain to get out.  Can be done with one hand.  I also purchased a survivor phone carrier, I plan on using that for the summer time, when I am not in the office as much.  Screen protector is sensitive and you can use all functions with the phone as if the cover wasn't there.  The sleep button has to be pushed a little harder, but your are putting a layer of rubber around it.  I found the directions on line at otter's website very helpful, as opposed to the pictures inside the box.  Great case for the money.  I don't know how well it will protect if dropped on cement or other hard surfaces, but the rubber grip makes it easy to keep in your hand.I have had this case for over two months. I have dropped it several times. Once on the marble floors of the school, once on a landscaping brick, and the other on a gravel road.

The rubber surround offers a good grip and protects against dropping. I really like the clip-on holster, very convenient. However, you have to make sure it's clipped securely or it can drop out. Also, I broke my first holster getting into a car - it caught on the seat back and the belt clip popped off.

I recently got this black Otterbox Defender and so far I'm very happy with it. I was initially concerned that I might get the first model which was made for the 4 and not the 4s. But I'm glad to report that I received the latest model, the one with the larger camera opening. I know that's what's in the picture, but as some of you can attest to, you don't always receive what's shown in a stock photo. I know I've been burned that way more than once. Other times I've read product descriptions that promised \"brand new in retail packaging\" only to receive the case in a clear plastic bag with no paperwork or labels of any kind. This seller lived up to his promise. I got the case in a retail Otterbox package with papers included. Thumbs up for the seller.To those that argue that the Defender case adds weight and bulk, you're absolutely right. And when using the included belt holster it feels a little too big and cumbersome, kinda like I've got a large growth on my hip. I feel a bit self-conscious about it so I don't carry it that way very often. I prefer my electronics as compact as possible. But......you can't get the level of protection for your precious iPhone that the Defender provides without adding some thickness to it. It just isn't possible. If you go thinner and lighter, you sacrifice protection. Simple logistics.The case fits very well. All buttons on the outer silicone case line up properly and work fine. The flap covering the charging port swings open for connecting your Apple charging cord. Non Apple fittings are often too wide,forcing you to remove the cover to plug them in. You need to consider that. I like the built-in screen protector.It provides extra protection when slipping the phone into my pocket (never with keys or loose change) and saves me from having to buy a separate piece of film. If you're one of those folks who doesn't care for any plastic covering your glass screen, the protector pops out with just a slight push, and can be put back in later if you change your mind. All in all I think the Defender is a good balance of form and function and highly recommend it.","reviewTime":"06 27, 2012","reviewerID":"A2NR61K6LW79XP","reviewerName":"Jafu","summary":"Excellent protection for my iPhone 4s","unixReviewTime":1340755200,"case":1,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":0,"get":1,"defender":1,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":0,"look":0,"price":0,"work":1,"box":1,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[2,2],"overall":2,"reviewText":"This case is very strong and will protect your phone, I'll give it that.

Before this case, I had on the Acase case, which was durable enough, but I still couldn't trust it enough to protect my iPhone 4s from all kinds of drops. With this Defender case, I have no doubt that my iPhone will be able to withstand any drops. I have dropped the phone couple times and went snowboarding with it. Despite multiple spills (it was my first time), the iPhone was hardly damaged and frankly, I was never worried that the phone would be damaged.However, despite being a fairly costly case, the Otterbox Defender case that I received had questionable build quality. First of all, you need to know that this case has two layers: inner plastic (yellow), and outer rubber layer (grey). After assembling the case, I noticed that the edges of the inner layer makes creaking noise when I press on the case. This tells me that the inner layer isn't completely sealed. (You can also tell this by seeing the slight rainbow effect, which goes away if I press on the case from top and bottom). As for the rubber outer layer, it doesn't completely cover the inner layer. At the top edges, you can see that the rubber had been made a little too large and so there is a visible gap. Can I live with it? Yes. Is it annoying? Yes. For a quality brand like Otterbox, I would have expected better quality control\/build quality.","reviewTime":"01 1, 2012","reviewerID":"AMIPJHB6A7NIJ","reviewerName":"Jay","summary":"Great case, marred only by shoddy build quality","unixReviewTime":1325376000,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":1,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":1,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":1,"month":1,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"this is a great product","reviewTime":"07 14, 2014","reviewerID":"A346R0OFURH161","reviewerName":"JC3","summary":"Five Stars","unixReviewTime":1405296000,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":0,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":0,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":0,"look":0,"price":0,"work":1,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":1,"reviewText":"The color did not show well in the photo.

Eventually it was annoying enough that I contacted Otterbox's customer service and asked for a replacement.They asked me to send them photos of the front and back, along with a receipt. I'd bought it on an auction site, cheap. I sent them the info and they quickly sent me a new Otterbox, no questions asked. This time, it was perfect.Only afterwards did I go back to the auction site to look up the seller and find out his account was cancelled... FOR SELLING FAKE OTTERBOXES.He'd had a solid reputation until the last few feedbacks, which were all like mine-- people complaining about their Otterboxes, and then realizing they were knock-offs. I hadn't even dreamed of such a thing. Fake designer handbags, yes. Fake phone cases? Nope, hadn't even imagined that.But I'm sure Otterbox has. They must be aware of this, and they knew I bought mine from an auction site, and they saw photos showing this weird moisture problem that they don't actually have with their product. And yet they never even mentioned it to me, or questioned me. That, to me, is great customer service-- they protected their brand name and set out to please a customer who likely didn't even pay for an Otterbox in the first place.But they obviously have just made a loyal customer out of me now. It's a great phone case. I love the color (light teal\/dark teal), I have no problem with the protective film, and I dropped my phone down a set of stairs onto a concrete basement floor and it was fine. That about says it all for me.","reviewTime":"06 22, 2012","reviewerID":"A5GPH59NDWJRB","reviewerName":"Jenna of the Jungle","summary":"Shout-Out for Great Customer Service","unixReviewTime":1340323200,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":1,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":0,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":1,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":1,"pocket":1,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"I got this cover for my mom for her new iphone4s for Christmas and she really likes it she says it great so far!!","reviewTime":"01 20, 2013","reviewerID":"A3ELP4BU8L0KAT","reviewerName":"jennifer","summary":"great cover!!!","unixReviewTime":1358640000,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":0,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":0,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":0,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"Ok, this is like the third time i have rated this.

I use mine with the holster.If you are the type that likes to carry your smart phone in your pocket instead of a holster, I would look for a different case.  This case adds quite a bit of bulk to the phone and the silicone rubber parts make it rather difficult to slide in and out of your front pocket.  But if you carry it in your back pocket, the silicone should help keep the phone from sliding out when you don't want it to.I will say, the case is not air or water tight.  You can't go swimming with it.  Dust gets inside of it somehow, too.  I have to take it apart and clean it every week.I highly recommend this case to anyone who needs great protection.  It's cheaper than an insurance plan on the phone, but does not provide full water tightness or dust tightness.","reviewTime":"07 6, 2013","reviewerID":"A506HOOCVL8GW","reviewerName":"J. Kurz \"J. Q.

I guess that as of 2009 or so they switched to a 1 year limited warranty; I was unaware because I have never needed to return an Otterbox item. My case started showing wear and several pieces came off. Because the rubber surround is what makes the case seem \"tight\" the box quickly became tattered looking even though the hard plastic shell and screen cover were in great shape. I didn't knock Otterbox any stars because of how quickly they responded to my request and shipped out the parts. I didn't have to call, I simply filled out the form online and was then emailed by a customer service rep with an incident number to track my case. They asked that I take photos and attach them and a description of the problem in a reply email. I did and within an hour I had an invoice emailed to me for the replacement part being shipped from the factory in Mexico. Their customer service was spot on, even though they no longer have a lifetime warranty - with iphones changing almost every year I wouldn't want a lifetime warranty in any case, I just got the 4s and already I'm behind the curve with the iphone 5. By the time my plan is set to renew and I get another subsidized phone in  a year there will no doubt be another iphone with a totally different form factor.","reviewTime":"08 2, 2012","reviewerID":"A110NS7T7F4Z7A","reviewerName":"Jose","summary":"This is the Chuck Norris of iPhone covers...","unixReviewTime":1343865600,"case":0,"phone":1,"otterbox":1,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":1,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":1,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":1,"month":1,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":1},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"Well, otterbox has always been a tough brand.

Although this is a good case and well worth the $20 I paid for it, its not perfect. The first issue I wont take any stars off for because its something the manufacturer dosent even claim and thats water resistance. It seems that with just a couple extra additions this case could be water resistant which would make it great rather than just good. As it is this case isn't even moisture or humidity resistant. If i keep it in the holster the heat from my body will cause enough condensation for it to get under the screen. A drop of water anywhere near this case and it somhow seems to make its way right insid the protective film. Real annoying.The second issue is what I am deducting 2 stars for though. The case at first glance appears to be well constructed with good attention to detail. Upon closer inspection however you will notice the rubber gasket that surrounds the hard shell bulges out in some places and over laps in others. I guess with this kind of manufacturing its hard to stick within exact tolerances. There are places all around the case where it just dosent fit perfectly. There are even a couple areas where there is just a bit too much plastic on the hard case. I't probably wont keep the case from functioning but it is bothersome. Again, for $20 its a solid purchase but for the $50 the brick and mortar stores are charging for it I would have taken it right back.Edit 8-11-12:The day after I received the case I returned it for another one. The fact that it didn't fit just right was annoying me. Although it didn't really interfere with the case functioning it just bothered me when i looked at it. The replacement case came quickly. The box was the same but the case inside was anything but. The fit and finish of the 2nd case was well beyond the first. No bits of hanging plastic or bulges in the rubber covering. The screen protector was clearer the rubber fit tighter all around (especially near the openings) and the case felt more solid. The colors were noticeably different. The original looked as if it were faded. Lastly the spring in the belt clip of the 2nd one is much stronger than the first.If I had not received the first case I would have given the 2nd one at least 4 stars. However, for Amazon sending either a fake or poorly manufactured one to me I'm giving it a 1. Hopefully anyone who gets a sub-par one will see my review and know to return it.","reviewTime":"08 9, 2012","reviewerID":"AOKQW4B5OQUXF","reviewerName":"jptsr1","summary":"I think I originally got a fake one.

It does protect the phone well, but how many adults are going to drop or sit on their phone that easily and require an armor that bulky?  I can see kids dropping or sitting on their phones, but not responsible adults.  The clear plastic screen that it comes with is easily scratched and it also takes away the clarity of iPhone's screen.  The only reason I got it is because Amazon is selling it a lot cheaper plus everyone was saying how you need such a case to protect your iPhone.  Now after using it for a couple of months, I went back to my simple white TPU slim case with a screen protector, which really does protect my phone if I ever drop it, and it's beautiful because it's pure white just like my iPhone and it doesn't add any bulk to the phone.","reviewTime":"08 16, 2012","reviewerID":"A368DWP3Z1GV1C","reviewerName":"JW","summary":"Too bulky and the screen is easily scratched.","unixReviewTime":1345075200,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":1,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":1,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":1,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":1,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"its a great case! my brother loves it!

The hard plastic case and the screen protector seem to be the same as the original, other than having larger cut outs for the camera\/flash and the front camera\/light sensor\/proximity sensor area. I never had issues using the 4s camera with the older version case, but I did with the proximity sensor and this case fixes that issue.The holster has been changed to update the release mechanism. The tab that holds the phone in the holster has been shaped differently in order to make the phone easier to clip in and release.The biggest upgrade is to the rubber jacket that fits over the plastic case. The rubber seems to be of much higher quality. It has a firmer, more substantial feel, and doesn't seem like it will lose shape over time. It gives the case a better grip in your hand and generally feels more solid overall.The opening for the silent mode switch seems to still be off center, but not enough to be of concern.If you are on the fence about whether to get the older iPhone 4 Otterbox Defender for your 4S or this updated version, I'd definitely pay the extra $10 or so and get the new version.","reviewTime":"10 31, 2011","reviewerID":"A1NNMN8XNH4264","reviewerName":"K.

The third is the thick cover I was referring to. I had to struggle to get it over the plastic pieces. I just worry that if I do drop it that the thick plastic will crack.  The last Otter Box I had, the casing was softer and pliable. But, it tore very quickly around the lock switch and the ear phone plug, as well as where the charger plug goes.

I was very surprised when the back looked like it was sweating. Then I remembered the water. I wiped it off and cleaned the camera eye and it was fine. It's seals tight enough that if water gets back there is doesn't dry easily. But by no means is it represented to be water repellant. I just didn't know water had gotten back there. Now I know!I am probably what you would calI over protective because I actually put one of those plasticky screen protectors over the plastic protector piece that is part of the Otter box just so I don't scratch my case.

With three young girls and a husband, I needed the added security that these expensive phones would not be broken with a slip of the hand.A little trick at first to figure out how to put on the case, once on, it looks great. I love the two tone colors. Just from the feel of it you can tell it will do the job it's meant to do. I love that there's a screen protector, though I'm a little miffed at the rainbow effect some end up with under the screen. My daughters aren't too happy that it makes their phones bulkier, thus not fitting into their pockets as well. Other than that, well worth the money for the added security and peace of mind.","reviewTime":"09 9, 2013","reviewerID":"A2BQWD54CXBX6R","reviewerName":"Kym McNabney \"Writing From The Soul\"","summary":"WELL WORTH THE MONEY","unixReviewTime":1378684800,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":1,"time":1,"product":0,"get":1,"defender":0,"rubber":0,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":1,"price":1,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":1,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":4,"reviewText":"loved the color scheme !!

I'm updating this because I've had the case for about 5 mos. now and it's not as great as I thought it would be, which is why I've dropped from 5 stars to 4. The protection lives up to its reputation because I have dropped it many times and my phone is not damaged in any way. There are 2 parts to this case- the inner, hard plastic then the outer, rubber covering. Well, the hard plastic case is fine, it's the rubber one that hasn't lasted. The port covers immediately started breaking and eventually falling off, which made the rubber loose and annoying and then more pieces falling off since it was so loose. My previous case was also an Otterbox and it also had the same issue but didn't start falling apart until many months later... maybe a year...? With this new case it lasted much less longer. Turns out others I know, with the exact same case, color and all, is also in the same bad shape. What a disappointment. I'm currently looking for another case and in the meantime still using this Otterbox.Wasn't expecting much change from this Otterbox for the iPhone 4s compared to the last one I had, which was the just 1 previous version before for the iPhone 4. But I like this one so much more! The outer rubber case has a much tighter fit and makes the phone a tiny bit smaller & sleeker than the last case did. It just seems less bulky. Also, the tighter fit is is especially nice in all the port flaps that now have a nice, tight close! It also has a better feel for me in it's texture compared to the last one-- it feels more substantial- don't know why!? My phone has already been dropped at least twice and my phone is fine- just what I expected with the Otterbox protection. One last comment: love the color! No surprises when I got it- not much difference from what's shown on Amazon- you know how tricky color on a computer can be, but no surprises here and I would definitely recommend this case to anyone!

It feels secure, which is exactly what I need for taking my phone out in the field.  On looks alone, maybe a 2.  The first comment I got from an office mate was \"That's one ugly case you have there.\"  The case nearly doubles the thickness of the phone and also keeps me from using any of the docking solutions I have.  The rubber on the case has a good feel, but it is tough to get it into and out of my pockets.  The microphone is surrounded by thick rubber, and I do see a noticeable degradation on microphone performance unless I lift up the headphone flap to clear some of the rubber away.  The rubber flap covering the iPhone connector stubbornly refuse to stay closed, so it's always flapping around.  On the positive side, the screen protector works great for me.  No loss of sensitivity.  All of the buttons work very well with little extra effort required to make them work.  Overall, recommended if you really need this much protection.  FOr something more stylish with decent protection, check out the Commuter or the cases from Seidio, which I have really liked in the past.","reviewTime":"07 23, 2012","reviewerID":"A1F1A0QQP2XVH5","reviewerName":"Mark B","summary":"Good protection; very bulky; rubber closures problematic","unixReviewTime":1343001600,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":1,"get":1,"defender":1,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":1,"price":0,"work":0,"box":1,"feel":1,"thing":0,"month":1,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":1,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":4,"reviewText":"I have had 2 of these cases so far and would definitely buy a third if needed.

That's why i got it.- The screen cover is a thin layer of plastic that when sitting on top of the iphone creates a 'film' illusion where if you have good vision you will see a hazy layer.  I think it's because there is a small space between the case's layer of plastic and the iphone's face that bends the light.  Its quite annoying to me. I would prefer no plastic at all on the screen front and use a stick on clear protector over the iphone face.-  The headphone jack is closed by a plastic piece that lifts up but it's annoying to have to fiddle with it to put in headphones.-  The case is fairly bulky and the plastic flap on the bottom of the case will prevent you from EVER using this in an ipod dock if the case is on.- The case takes a couple minutes at least to remove and it's annoying to do if you would be doing it more than once a month or so.- The case is very bad in moist environments, worse than no case at all because moisture gets trapped under the plastic film on top of the iphone screen and you will see a \"spread out water droplet effect.\"  I learned this after I worked out with the phone and noticed the effect.This case is ideal for dry sandy environments where dropping the phone on the hard surface is a possibility, I still recommend it if you can get over the negatives.","reviewTime":"12 6, 2011","reviewerID":"A32XWBSZWC3SNR","reviewerName":"Marky Mark \"Mark\"","summary":"I wish there was something a little better","unixReviewTime":1323129600,"case":0,"phone":1,"otterbox":1,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":1,"get":0,"defender":1,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":1,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":1,"feel":1,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":1,"silicone":0,"clip":1,"pocket":0,"belt":1,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"This case truly protects my iphone.

I have used an Otterbox on all of my iPhones, dating back to my first iPhone. The durability is excellent. I've dropped my phone a few times and my toddler has played with it (after she snuck into my purse to get to it), and someone has even sat on it! My otterbox has protected my phone from everything.The front part of the Otterbox is a screen protector in itself. This eliminates the need to apply any form of screen protector on your own. This is much simpler than applying those clear sheets you can buy online. Just remove the rubber exterior, snap off the hard plastic inner shell, place your cellphone inside, then put it back together. I have had no issues with using the touch screen or any other problems.The best part of using the Otterbox is when my last iPhone died, it kept my phone is such pristine condition that I was able to bring it to my wireless provider and they bought my phone (which they will sell as refurbished) for nearly the entire price of my new phone. They bought my iPhone for $150, and combined with the discount, and the contract price, I left with the newest version of the iPhone for $50! Thanks Otterbox!!!!","reviewTime":"06 14, 2013","reviewerID":"A1LX95ESZ0HDYL","reviewerName":"M.

Things like play dough get stuck in the pattern and are a pain to get out. Another problem is the built in screen protector, no oil slick, but when it gets even a small scratch it ruins the illusion that its clear. The port protectors are a plus, but it can be annoying t o have a piece of rubber sticking out when you are using headphones. I only recommend this case if you are willing so sacrifice slimness for protection.UPDATE-My case has bit the dust after months of usage.

I had gotten it before the price went back up, so it was only 17$ for me. But it's much better than paying 50$ for an otterbox. As for the quality? I love it. I've read some reviews where it says the outermost layer of the 3 layers gaps, it really doesn't. Theirs was probably stretched out. Just be careful when disassembling the case to put it on or take it off and make sure you don't over stretch it. As you can imagine I was wary at first because the price made me think I was getting a low quality version of an otterbox. I was wrong. It's worked so well, and protected it from so much. I use my phone quite often and the box has protected it. Some reviews are saying that it's way bulky. Well, I don't quite think they used logic when thinking this through. It's a three layer box protecting your phone. It's going to be a bit bulky. At first it takes some time to get used to it, but it's worth it. It's honestly not that much bigger than normal and the protection it gives outweighs the bulkiness. I'd highly suggest buying it for this price. I mean, it's much less than the 50$ it normally is and it's got the same exact otterbox protection.EDIT:: My sister bought one off of this listing as well, and her outtermost gray gel gapped really fast. I've had mine for about six months now, and it has just started gapping. I've now bought three other replacement gels off of amazon for $.99 and it's not that bad of price, but still fairly annoying how it stretches and loses it's elasticity.","reviewTime":"01 1, 2013","reviewerID":"A2TI945ZY9STGV","reviewerName":"Nancy","summary":"LOVED THE PRICE.","unixReviewTime":1356998400,"case":0,"phone":1,"otterbox":1,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":1,"rubber":0,"color":0,"bulky":1,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":1,"work":0,"box":1,"feel":0,"thing":1,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":1,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":4,"reviewText":"The all around encasement of this is a great concept.

This leads to two problems: (1) the  materials around the flap  where it docks is starting to warp and (2) the flap covers the home button, preventing me from using it while it is in dock;3. the top cover of the case is so thick that the pinhole it leaves for the mic on the top left of the iPhone interferes (in a small way) with the mic;4. the holes in the back of the case seems to cause the iPhone 4S (at least the black model) to gather dust; and5. the bulk - although this to be fair is just the price that I voluntarily pay for the protection.However, these are minor complaints and overall it is a great product.","reviewTime":"06 27, 2012","reviewerID":"A215GC5E0VJO1E","reviewerName":"newnewy","summary":"Great product, with some minor flaws","unixReviewTime":1340755200,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":1,"get":1,"defender":1,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":0,"look":0,"price":1,"work":1,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":1,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":4,"reviewText":"This is a very tough case and the color is very strong.

I went to the ATT store, and the salesman told me it is very difficult to avoid the watermark problem.  It happens or it doesn't.  Doesn't appear when phone is on, so who really cares?If the knowledge that the watermark is there will bother you, get a Speck with a Moshi Ivisor.  No watermark, but not as rugged.My wife carries her Iphone 5 in her purse, and the Speck Ivisor combo works great for her.","reviewTime":"10 11, 2012","reviewerID":"A2XAKGRUHIE2ZA","reviewerName":"P.

So when I upgraded to the 4S, it was no different. I had to have the Defender. The thing I caution buyers is to make sure the case supports the 4S because of the wider camera hole in the back of the case. This case has lived up to its standards from Otterbox. At first I had a hard time opening the case because I couldn't figure out how to remove the outer rubber part. It's different than the 3GS case. A kind rep from ATT showed me how to do it even though I didn't buy it from the store. Once the phone was secure inside, everything fit smoothly. Now I know how to remove and insert the phone in the case. It's so easy that even a blind guy can do it. And since I'm blind, then that statement makes perfect sense. My suggestion is for you to watch a video of someone putting the phone in the case in case you are not sure how. Some people have given negative ratings on the Defender series cases because of the added bulk. However, to me this is a plus because the added bulk adds to the protection.Pros: Well fitting. Looks stylish with the white iPhone. Excellent protection. All buttons, including the mute switch easily accessible.Cons: Screen protector sometimes bows out, preventing successful swipes. Rubber seems like it might stretch if you remove it too much.All in all, an excellent case, and highly recommended.","reviewTime":"02 1, 2012","reviewerID":"A39HB69V29EDTX","reviewerName":"R.

I've dropped it 100 times on a concrete floor, used it in the rain, used it with filthy hands while driving a tractor (but I don't text and dig), used it for music while mowing a dusty lawn, used it while getting covered in snow, etc. Looking at the phone, you'd never know it. There's a very slight wear mark on the side metal from the case, but very unnoticable.Some dust and junk collects in the exposed speakers, but that's not necessarily a flaw of the case.Some flaws of the case:- a plastic locking tab broke off recently. Still worked fine, but looked cheesy- the rubber sheath can wear out. I've also had varying quality in the 3 of these sheaths I've tried. One was hard rubber, one was silicone bead soft (almost slimy feeling), another was in the middle. The one I kept has a very obvious wear pattern around the home button, a slight tear at the charging cover, and rounded edges from wear.- the plastic screen protector is not super-clear. In the 3 cases I tried, each had a different hue or clarity. I adjusted to it and never noticed again until removing the phone from the case and seeing how clear the display was without it.I just upgraded to a Nokia, and am very disappointed there's not an Otterbox for it.","reviewTime":"01 24, 2014","reviewerID":"A2P5IW6KAGGNI3","reviewerName":"Rob R","summary":"Best case ever","unixReviewTime":1390521600,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":1,"thing":1,"month":1,"year":1,"silicone":1,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":1},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[1,1],"overall":5,"reviewText":"I bought this over a year ago, and she still has it on her phone.

Don't get me wrong, protection was never compromised, but the rubber surround was tearing in various places because of the extreme duty the case had seen.  When the port cover finally ripped off, it was time to replace.  The new Otterbox Hybrid iPhone 4\/4s Defender case is spectacular.  The entire fit and function of this case seems leaps and bounds ahead of the Otterbox case I originally purchased almost 2 years ago.  It appears that the rubber or silicone compound used for the outer layer has been reengineered to be much better.  It is much stiffer, but more lightweight than the original.  The updated form factor is smaller than the last generation case I had, but still makes me confident in the ability to protect the device.  After installing the new cover, it was apparent that the old generation cover that I thought was the best protection for her iPhone just got a whole lot better!Pros:- Best protection for the iPhone of any case I have used (and that is quite a few)- New rubber compound is much better, fits tighter, and does not collect as much lint and dust from your pocket\/purse- Feels much lighter than the previous generation- Gives me piece of mind that I won't have to worry about the phone when (not if) it is dropped next- New openings on the front and rear of the case cameras fix the deficiancies found in the last generation offeringCons:- A little bulkier than some slim cases, but they don't offer near the protection.In summary, this is a great case.  Some people think the price is a con because it is too much.  I have a friend that pays for monthly phone insurance and just dropped a $125 deductible down for a replacement phone after dropping theirs.  If they had an Otterbox Defender on their phone, they would still have the $125.  From my perspective, the price is very fair, and Amazon constantly has deals, so look back often for the best deal.","reviewTime":"06 5, 2012","reviewerID":"A28UJ9RRG42LNB","reviewerName":"Roux","summary":"Much improved over the 1st Generation iPhone 4 offering","unixReviewTime":1338854400,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":0,"get":1,"defender":1,"rubber":1,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":1,"work":0,"box":1,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":1,"year":0,"silicone":1,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":1},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"it looks nice and it fits very well, my bf constantly drops his phone and this has done an awesome job at protecting the very sensitive iphone.","reviewTime":"03 3, 2014","reviewerID":"A2XFKSHT3XRSNL","reviewerName":"Roxx","summary":"works very well","unixReviewTime":1393804800,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":0,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":1,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":0,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"What more can you say?

After doing research I decided to get this item. My first reaction was most definitely surprised because it is a big case. The case itself is very bulky and has three layers of protection to protect the phone. It aligns perfectly with the volume and power buttons and has clasps that you can close and open for the core openings such as the charging input and headphone jack input so you can get complete protection by covering them when they are not in use. The front of the case has a built in plastic screen protector, so you do not need to purchase additional screen protectors for the phone. Even though this case is truly an amazing product, it still isn't perfect. This case makes your phone very bulky which makes it difficult for the person to store it in their pocket, also it is extremely difficult to open the case so just incase you need to take your phone out, it might be a hassle but for the protection it provides, it isn't a huge deal. Overall amazing product and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a heavy duty case.

I also wanted a bit more protection as the old case really only protected the back of the phone and not the front. This one protects the back, front, top, bottom, and sides. To my surprise the rubber gasket seals the inner plastic snap case fairly well. It will provide a much better protection from dust and dirt and for me pocket lint. The inner plastic shell that the phone slips into is made well and adds to the protection. There are small rubber doors that pop open to let you charge it as well as use headphones and another door for putting your phone on silent (switch) the volume and standby have buttons.My reason for only 4 stars is for two reasons. One is that it does add a bit of bulk to the phone but its a small inconvenience to have the protection this case gives. the second reason is that the built in plastic screen makes the screen look like it has artifacts meaning its not super clear. I just may cut it out and take my chances because it really does take away from the iPhones glorious screen sharpness. Other than that I'm super happy.

It does make the iPhone a little bit bigger for obvious reasons. It has a hard inner shell to protect the iPhone and a soft outer shell to keep it from slipping out of your hand.The outer shell has two minor problems - at least for the black model, my wife has the pink\/black which has a slightly different outer shell. The black outer shell is very soft and attracts lint as one of the user photos shows. It is easy to wipe off but every time you pull it out of your pocket it will have some lint.The charger cover comes loose occassionaly but still covers the slot to prevent dirt or lint getting in.The two issues I mentioned are minor and don't hinder the protection this case offers. I'm not going to drop it to test it but I do know someone who did and their iPhone came out unscathed.

I can't remember exactly who the seller on the other purchase was, but the seller on this was Otto Box, and both were fulfilled by Amazon. When I received my last Defender, it was in horrible shape, and I didn't even know how bad it was until I received this one. There were scratches on the screen protector which bothered me, and the phone kept falling out of the holster almost immediately. The other company let me keep it, but gave me a full refund, and then I ordered this one thinking; at least with this color scheme I'll be able to tell which is mine if set down near someone else's iPhone with Defender (and we all know just about everyone has an Otterbox these days.) This thing is amazing. I actually have to put effort into getting the silicone sleeve to stretch around the plastic shell, but the effort is worth it in more than one way; it feels like the case is part of the phone now. On top of that, I realize there's supposed to be a small foam pad in the back part of the shell that presses the phone screen to the screen protector flush, so that there isn't any interruption of touch sensitivity in the corners (like on the other Defender I received.) The bottom flap that covers the dock port actually seals into place on this one; apparently my other Defender was missing a lip that locked it in. The only scratch I've seen on this one at all is on the inside of the protector that goes over the Apple logo on the back of my phone that isn't even visible while the case is on. And one other bonus I didn't even expect; due to how snug this new Defender case fits my phone, and maybe even less wear on the holster itself, my phone would have to be stripped like a football to come out of the clip-holster; its so snug that I find myself actually having to hold my phone in case, and lever the retaining arm to pull the phone out of the holster, so I get the feeling I'm going to have many less accidental drops than with my last one. I don't know how I got such a crappy case in all-black, and ended up with retail quality standards on this purchase when they were both fulfilled by Amazon, and both about the same price, but I can say that I'm definitely happy with the quality and durability of this new case. My wife isn't very fond of the colors (being gunmetal grey and peony pink,) but again, at least I'll know which is mine.","reviewTime":"06 24, 2012","reviewerID":"ASDYXS80RUUO0","reviewerName":"Struggling77","summary":"Perfect?

My 5 year old borrows it all the time and so far so good.  Its also survived several drops just fine.  My only complaint (not enough to drop a star) is that the grey silicone does not quite meet the white plastic in the front and leaves a gap.  The other Defender cases my family owns do not do this, so its only the particular one I got, I guess.  It won't affect protection, I do not think, so I did not return it, but if you are anal like I am, its a little annoying.  BUT I still love it.

My main objective in purchasing a case was the best protection possible for my phone. I am not disappointed.This Defender series Otterbox is basically three pieces - a two-piece hard plastic case and a thick, silicone skin which covers the plastic case. A clear plastic membrane is integrated into the hard plastic case which covers your entire screen. There is also a hard plastic holster with a ratcheting clip for wearing your phone on your hip.I took off a star for the poor directions on how to put your phone into the case. (Because of the 3 pieces and the perfect fit, it is a little complicated getting it apart, installing the phone and then getting it back together.) There is no insert or directions in the box. Only when you remove the Otterbox from the packaging do you see a few illustrations (which are very small and not nearly detailed enough) on how to use this case. I searched YouTube and found several videos that showed plainly how to do it and I would suggest others do the same if they haven't used an Otterbox before. I am mystified as to why Otterbox would make such an excellent product and then neglect to include better directions for installing your phone in the case.The fit is perfect and the silicone which covers the buttons is soft and flexible so it doesn't impair using the buttons. The clear membrane doesn't affect the responsiveness of the touch screen. The hard plastic case features a lip which is raised up from the screen so your phone will be safe if you drop it face down. The back of the case is covered in textured silicone which helps you grip your phone. Really, it's like Fort Knox  for your 4S!Be aware that for this level of protection, you sacrifice the sleekness of your phone. This case adds substantial bulk and gives it a clunkier look and feel. The holster is REALLY bulky, too. If that will ruin the iPhone experience for you, I would look at the Otterbox Commuter series. But if you want ultimate protection for your iPhone 4S, it would be difficult to find a better case than this one.","reviewTime":"12 7, 2011","reviewerID":"A1FDSZISWIXH1A","reviewerName":"Terry \"tcinsatx@yahoodotcom\"","summary":"Fits my 4S perfectly","unixReviewTime":1323216000,"case":0,"phone":1,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":1,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":1,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":1,"box":1,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":1,"silicone":1,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":1,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"I highly recommend this product.

If you have an iPhone 4S and you don't have this case yet... all I can say is what are you waiting for?","reviewTime":"07 11, 2012","reviewerID":"A30VWT3R25QAVD","reviewerName":"THE-DEADLY-DOG \"Living and Loving Life.\"","summary":"Easily The Best Case Out There","unixReviewTime":1341964800,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":1,"time":0,"product":1,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":0,"price":0,"work":0,"box":1,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":1,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"you can't go wrong with an otterbox.  this is a great product and worth every penny.  i highly recommend this case.","reviewTime":"03 7, 2014","reviewerID":"A1UG831B87CNEV","reviewerName":"T","summary":"love it","unixReviewTime":1394150400,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":0,"product":0,"get":0,"defender":0,"rubber":0,"color":0,"bulky":0,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":0,"look":0,"price":0,"work":1,"box":0,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":0,"clip":0,"pocket":0,"belt":0,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"The otterbox is the best case that I have EVER purchased for an iPhone.

The only negative thing Id say is the rubber that's around the case itself... I haven't had it very long & my rubber has a small rip in it.

This was the first smart phone I have ever owned. Based upon conversations with friends and after doing some research, I purchased the OTTERBOX DEFENDER FOR IPHONE 4 to protect my iPhone 4. I would never own a smart phone without having excellent protection for it. Smart phones (even ones from 2-3 generations ago) are not inexpensive to replace. Also, I&#8217;m kind of a klutz: I tend to occasionally drop my phone at the most inopportune times (on the blacktop of the parking lot after getting out of the car, for instance); so not having something that really protects my phone is not an option.After having placed the OTTERBOX DEFENDER FOR IPHONE 4 on my phone almost immediately after purchasing it seven months ago, I can say that I am satisfied with this product. I have dropped by phone countless times on concrete, blacktop, and in one instance down a stairwell. My iphone4 has been protected and doesn&#8217;t have one scratch on it. Also, although the case is not waterproof, it does provide some basic protection to a phone from raindrops and other very small droplets of water (you can&#8217;t drop your phone in the toilet or use it in the shower, but if you&#8217;re carrying it in your pocket during a rainstorm, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it too much).Also, although the OTTERBOX DEFENDER FOR IPHONE4 is fairly heavy, I like the overall look and feel of it.With that said, I do have a couple complaints about the item. First, in the summer when carrying my phone in my pocket, the case of the phone seems to attract sweat to it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s absorbing the sweat from my pants\/shorts pocket or what, but there were numerous instances over the summer that I had to completely take my phone out of the Otterbox case so I could wipe away the liquid buildup that had somehow accumulated.Secondly, the outer silicone covering of the case is rather flimsy and feels like rubber and is not as durable as I thought it would be. Currently, after seven months of use, the little flaps covering the volume switch and the USB port have worn away and are now only staying in place by a small piece of the silicone. I find this quite disappointing.Overall, my OTTERBOX DEFENDER FOR IPHONE4  has been a worthwhile investment. There are some minor flaws with the product, but the case has kept my phone safe and protected. With that said, these flaws will make me seriously look at other products in the future (such as the LifeProof case).","reviewTime":"12 18, 2013","reviewerID":"A96K1ZGW56S2I","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Will Keep Your Phone Safe from Falls and Drops","unixReviewTime":1387324800,"case":0,"phone":0,"otterbox":0,"iphone":1,"screen":0,"protection":0,"time":1,"product":1,"get":1,"defender":0,"rubber":1,"color":1,"bulky":1,"protector":1,"use":0,"drop":1,"look":1,"price":0,"work":1,"box":1,"feel":0,"thing":0,"month":0,"year":0,"silicone":1,"clip":0,"pocket":1,"belt":1,"part":0,"quality":0},{"asin":"B005SUHPO6","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5,"reviewText":"Very nice product it just didn't help my daughter.

I own several digitaldevices and I have an OtterBox on each and every one of them.  When you invest that kind of money in your electronics you want to protect that investment with the best.  OtterBox is it!!  Triple layer security for peace of mind.  You can trust that it has a true fit and is going to last.

A little tight to put on but once it is on it fits great.  This is a replacement due to my dropping my phone and breaking the Otterbox.  Replacement of the Otterbox is a whole lot cheaper than replacing my apple 4.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is wanting great protection for their apple 4 or 5.","reviewTime":"01 7, 2013","reviewerID":"A254U5MT8HVXTN","reviewerName":"W.

While a hardcase I had for my last Android phone started to break in pieces from being dropped several time, this one is still in one piece months later. It fell out of my pocket twice while riding my bike, for example, and to me relief was fine aside from some scratches. The silicone layer is easy to take off as is the harder shell without worry of the phone falling out on impact. My two sole complaints are that somehow hairs get inside and that the holster breaks easily. Worth the investment for extra protection!EDIT: Five months later since writing this review the rubber is starting to break apart. Still works great otherwise.","reviewTime":"11 10, 2012","reviewerID":"A208PLQCP3M12U","reviewerName":"Wyatt J.
