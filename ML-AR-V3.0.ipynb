I didn't want to have to deal with trying to return a cheap $3 charger to some random company and risk that it would put my Droid on the fritz.  The extra few bucks was great for peace of mind.

It definitely charges more quickly than most generic chargers ever will, the light, while obvious, is not distracting like some have suggested, and the thing lasts 10 times longer than any other charger I've used. I purchased this one for a friend who needed a car charger...and I've purchased more than 8 so far and currently have been running the same two in my personal car with ZERO issue for over 4 years.It's cheaper than ANY charger you'd buy at your wireless store and only barely more expensive than the cheap generic chargers you can find (that often are loose in the socket or the phone) and I'm glad I made the switch\",\n",

I've had the same issue with mini usb to micro usb adapters from Motorola - bought half a dozen of them and none of them work reliably. I won't buy a motorolla micro usb connector again.

This, my Droid, and theCar Dockmake a very happy trio for navigation in my car.However, there are a few minor concerns I'd like to point out: First, the blue LED. Not only does the end of the charger seem to only take up space and shamelessly promote Motorola, the blue LED creates a bit of a distraction, at least where my cigarette lighter is in my vehicle. I'm thinking of taking it apart and removing the LED, but I don't travel at night too much with it so I might let it slide. Second, I've noticed that sometimes it doesn't actually charge the phone, just keep it powered - but to be fair, this is probably either my Droid or the car, not the fault of the charger itself.I haven't had a chance to try charging any other MicroUSB devices with my charger, but I can only assume it works swimmingly.

       " 'There are so many sketchy sellers selling phone chargers out there, that it can be a bit scary. The problem is that if the charger is poorly made, the output of the charger can be out of spec and can, in some cases, fry the phone you connect to it.For that reason, when it comes to phone chargers, you should stick to name brands. (They are all made in China, but the name brand ones are usually subject to stricter QA).When I found this charger on Amazon, SOLD BY AMAZON, I jumped on it. It\\'s a MICRO USB car charger, made for Motorola and sold under the Motorola name, in retail packaging. The rated output is 4.75-5.25V and 950mA.This charger should work fine with most any phone that uses the MICRO USB connector. The key number to pay attention to is the second one, the rated amperage. This is the MAXIMUM amount of current that the phone can request from the charger. A typical USB port on a PC provides as little as 100mA, and few provide more than 500mA. So this charger should charge your phone faster than when it\\'s connected to a PC. A few phones out now can use up to 1000mA. But that just means they CAN use that amount. If 950mA is provided, they\\'ll still charge, just a bit more slowly.Note that the amperage (second number) merely tells you how much the charger CAN supply, if requested. The phone itself is responsible for asking for the current. That is to say, if this charger can provide 950mA, but your phone can only use 300mA--no problem. Your phone asks for 300mA and the charger provides all of what is requested. If, on the other hand, your phone can use 1000mA, this charger will provide all it can, which is 950mA--a wee bit less than the max asked for. That\\'s also not a problem; it just means your phone will charge a little bit (not much in this case) more slowly. The rated voltage for this charger is presented in a range of 4.75-5.25V. The \"ideal\" voltage for a USB charger of any type if 5V. And most chargers for home use are rated right at 5V. But car chargers work in a noisier environment and thus you have the range. This is where a cheapo charger can really do damage, as some of them are poorly regulated and can provide voltages that are WAY out of spec. Again, when you can get a name brand charger from a seller you can trust (Amazon) for such a reasonable price, it\\'s very foolish to consider the cheapo no-names.This is an excellent quality name brand travel micro USB charger at a price that beats the no-name junk from third party sellers. What\\'s not to like?BE SURE TO ORDER IT FROM AMAZON AND NOT ONE OF THE THIRD PARTY SELLERS, as some of those have been known to make mistakes with respect to what they ship relative to the listing. I can confirm that Amazon is shipping the P513 /89143N charger, as pictured.',\n",

The inner bag identifies it as a SPN5400A, part #11224-0817337; both numbers are on the charger, though the second is 11224-CC-0817337, and also has CHR-0291 imprinted on it. (Check the image gallery.) The outer bag carried the part #PVN1616, and a barcoded number, 760492-013772, I don\\'t know what those are, stocking codes?As demonstrated in another buyer\\'s video review, the MicroUSB plug has a holographic QA sticker (doesn\\'t have Motorola logo, just a \"check mark\" graphic). The obverse of the plug has the Motorola \"M\" clearly and cleanly molded into it. The plug is molded as one, solid piece. The charger portion is okay, nothing fancy or super-solid, but it holds together. Part numbers are clearly printed on it. It also has a handy little clip on the cord (visible in the first product image) that lets you keep the cord together, either in storage or in use.Pardon the pun, but the proof is in the plug-in. As measured on my HTC Amaze 4G, this charger provides up to 800mA of charging current while plugged into an AC adapter, compared with 400mA from a similar Duracell car charger. In my car, the charger provides slightly less, but still sufficient to charge the phone while Waze is working (which uses the display, GPS receiver, and 4G network for maps). This is what I\\'ve been looking for, as other lesser chargers actually let the phone\\'s battery drain down due to insufficient charging current. A charger that provides ~800mA - 900mA means the difference of an hour or so LESS to completely charge up, compared with a ~300mA - 400mA charger, if the phone is not in use.Because so many buyers of this and other chargers complain of counterfeit or substituted products for what are listed as OEM replacements, I urge you to buy only direct from Amazon. Ensure the transaction is covered by Amazon\\'s usual product return guarantee, so that if you do get a substitution or fake, you can return it for a full refund, without paying for shipping.

It will deliver up to 950mA of power. Most of the newer smart phones can draw 1A of power, so this charger will work perfectly for them. It will show on your phone as an AC power charge. This will charge your phone quickly and easily, even with multiple apps running, including GPS navigation and 4G.If your phone charges at less than 1A, that is still fine. It will NOT overcharge your phone. The charger can deliver UP TO 950mA, which means it will only deliver what is asked of it. If your phone only pulls 500mA, then it will only deliver 500mA.The construction quality is great. It seems solid and well built. I fully expect this to last a long time. It is a very attractive design, with stylish blue lighting. I don't know the exact length, but the cord is longer than most, and supple. It will easily and comfortably reach anywhere on or around the front seat.My girlfriend and I both have this charger, and we've both used them extensively. I can personally attest to its ability to fully charge while using GPS navigation, 4G, and running multiple apps during an extended 7 hour drive across the state. Using both her Incredible, and my Evo.This is a great price for such a quality cable. You should not be paying 20.00 dollars or more from the major phone carriers. Buy this, and you will be more than satisfied in every way. This is a much bette cable than anything the carriers sell.I am completely thrilled with this cable, and will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone, and purchase them as needed for gifts for others.Hope that helps...\",\n",

Even with the standard factory car charger (which is 500 ma), the battery still drains while the phone is being used as a GPS.After doing some research I came across this charger (which supplies 950ma) and from the buzz online it seemed like it would do the trick for me.  Well, it's an improvement over the standard 500ma charger, though not perfect.I find that on full brightness - which is typical of what you'll need for daytime car GPS usage - the battery still drains even when using this charger.  Bummer.  To be fair, the drain is much lower than the standard 500ma charger, and drastically less than using no charger at all, but the battery still slowly drops nonetheless.  If you drop the screen brightness, or turn the screen off for extended highway drives, then the battery drop all but ceases.So that is only a minor drawback.  A bigger drawback for me is that on several occasions my phone has overheated and frozen while using this charger with my phone's GPS fuction.  This required me unplugging the charger and rebooting my phone to remedy.  This is a HUGE pain when you are behind the wheel and driving somewhere you are unfamiliar with.  Keep in mind the standard 500ma charger would have no such overheating problems.  Apparently the engineers at Samsung specified the 500ma current in order to maintain full functionality of the phone under all conditions - even car GPS usage.  Anything over that is not within spec and could cause the phone to overheat under certain circumstances.That said, I am still fairly happy with the charger.

It's basically sticking an advertisement for Motorola into your car, who wants that?Second, the price you pay, you can easily afford a dual-usb socket, which while meaning you'd have to provide your own USB cables, means you can charge two items at once, and it's not in your way as those sockets are relatively tiny.Third, the item emits a blue light, that illuminates the center plastic piece.

After a longer period of time, while my comments on the durability / construction of the charger remain valid, the power output is pretty minimal and I am changing my rating from a 4 star to a 3 star: charging my Motorola phone takes a heck of a long time if the power level is less than 50% and, for example, when it isdown to 20% and plugged in during a two-hour drive, it consistently never gets above 50% charged.\",\n",

She loves it and it works very well on her phone. The blue LED is not too bright for night-driving yet bright enough to see in daytime so you know it's plugged in. My recommendation would be to get a USB car charger so you can use whatever cable you want and since you have two separate pieces, if one fails, you only have to replace that part, not the whole thing. This however, follows the K.I.S.S. principle and works very well. I would highly recommend.\",\n",

The after-market companies products never seem to last. So if you're thinking about getting a car charger then I suggest getting this one.

Would buy again and have recommended to friends.\",\n",
       " \"This is second one I got for another car so I don't have to move it around.  The blue light works great because it tells you if it's been plugged in correctly (at least to the car battery).  This time I wish the cable is a little longer 'cause the outlet is further away.  If you need more than 24 inches, you may want another choice because the coiled cable does not stretch well.\",\n",

       " 'Note that I purchased this charger directly from Amazon and not from one of the other shippers. After being pleased with the first one, I tried to purchase 2 more, but Amazon limited me to 1. I purchased the third charger from another shipper, and I worry that it won\\'t be authentic.I received this charger in a baggie containing a statement of Motorola warranty. On the underside of the charger, the input/output electrical specifications were given in Spanish. So I think this product comes from a Spanish Motorola inventory. The electrical specifications clearly state an output current of 950mA at 4.75--5.25V. There is a plastic clip (visible in the picture) on onside of the coil that lets the coil fold in two. That helps keep cable management clean in the car.On my way to work this morning, with my HTC Rezound smartphone initially charged to 90%, I turned on navigation and left the screen on. The sun was out, and so the phone became warm in its windshield mount. Nonetheless, I arrived at work with the phone at 94% and starting to pulse its current draw to reduce incoming current. So the charger did its job nicely.So I am very happy with this charger. For under $6, it\\'s a high-rate charger from a recognizable source.The low price and the fact that Amazon limits the number a single buyer can purchase makes me think that this charger will soon not be available for sale. Get it while you can. Nice unit (if you get the real version from Moto). Hopefully it lasts for a while.SIDE NOTE: If you are looking for a dual-output charger suitable for tablets, I also have recently tried the \"Mediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger (3.1 Amp)\" and was pretty pleased with it. I didn\\'t try it with tablets, but it performed the same test as above with the same results (if not better), and so I\\'m pretty confident it really will deliver the 3.1A it promises if necessary (and certainly the 2.1A needed for a single tablet plugged in).',\n",

I actually lost battery life while running the phone GPS with the charger plugged in.  Bottom line is that this charger doesn't have enough voltage to charge the phone.  I never had a problem with my previous charger that broke after 2 years.  I tried charging my phone on the way to church (a 30 minute drive)without any apps running and it only increased the battery life by 5%.  for the record I have a Motorola Photon 4g.

Never had one fail or have had to wiggle the micro USB end to get it to work like all the el-cheapo ones I had before.

I also like the coiled cord, as it means I don't have a long cord hanging around my console. The charger itself feels high quality, so it should last for quite some time.
