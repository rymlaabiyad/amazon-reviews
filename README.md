# Setup
* Open the init.cfg file and change both the path and the file name if needed. Keep that file in the same directory as 'data_retriever.py'
* Open a command line, go to the directory where you put 'requirements.txt', and run :
    conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
    OR
    pip install -r requirements.txt
* Run main.py
